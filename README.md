D3ROS-EHP-DPS-CALCULATOR
========================

Simple Calculator to help TheoryCraft Diablo III: Reaper of Souls

Quick note: This is just a simple calculator I whipped up since D3up.com doesn't support RoS.  Feel free to use it how you please.

How to use: 
1.) Open it up
2.) Input your stats from your character sheet. Do not include +ResAll, +Armor%, and +:ife% from your paragon points on the left side.  If you have points in Vitality, they should be fine.
3.) Input your paragon defensive points.

DPS Calculator Tab coming soon!
